### Claude Desktop

Add to your MCP configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "dota-management": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/dota-management-mcp-server/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "DOTA_API_URL": "http://localhost:3000"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## API Coverage

This MCP server covers the following Dota management operations:

✅ **Organization operations** - List orgs, org-scoped app listing  
✅ **Application lifecycle** - Create, get, list applications  
✅ **Deployment management** - Full CRUD operations for deployments  
✅ **Release management** - Update, promote, and track releases  
✅ **Collaboration** - Manage team access to applications  
✅ **Analytics** - Deployment metrics and release statistics  

❌ **Excluded** (as requested):
- Token management APIs (security sensitive)
- Account management APIs (user data sensitive)
- Create release API (requires file uploads not supported via MCP)

## Release Creation

To create initial releases with actual files, use the Dota CLI:

```bash
# Create initial release with files
dota release MyApp ./app-files 1.0.0 -d Staging

# Then use MCP tools to manage and promote
# promote_release(MyApp, "Staging", "Production", "v1.0.0")
```

## Authentication

All tools require a valid authentication token passed as the `authToken` parameter. The server supports:

- Bearer token authentication
- Organization/tenant scoping via `tenant` parameter
- Proper error handling for unauthorized requests

## Testing

Run the included test script:

```bash
node test-mcp.js
```

This validates:
- Server initialization ✅
- Tool discovery (16 tools) ✅
- MCP protocol compliance ✅

## Error Handling

The server includes comprehensive error handling:
- **API errors** - Proper HTTP error response forwarding
- **Validation errors** - Input validation with helpful messages  
- **Network errors** - Connection and timeout handling
- **Authentication errors** - Clear auth failure messages

## Development

- **TypeScript** - Fully typed with comprehensive interfaces
- **Zod validation** - Runtime input validation for all tools
- **Modular design** - Clean separation of concerns
- **Comprehensive logging** - Detailed error reporting

## Dependencies

- `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` - MCP protocol implementation
- `axios` - HTTP client for API requests
- `zod` - Runtime input validation
