## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Docker Desktop (must be running)
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Google OAuth configuration (optional)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ds-horizon/dota
```

2. Create environment files:
```bash
./env.dev.sh
```
This script copies `env.web.dev` from the root directory into `.env` files in both `api` and `web` directories.

3. Navigate to the API directory:
```bash
cd api
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev:web
```

After successful installation, you should see:
- Server running at `http://localhost:3010`
- CLI logged in (verify with `dota --version` and `dota whoami`)
- Web server running at `http://localhost:3000`
