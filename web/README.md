## Web Dashboard Usage Guide

### App Management
The app management section allows you to create and manage applications for your organization. Before you can deploy any updates, you need to register an app with the DOTA service.
All new apps automatically come with two deployments (Staging and Production).

**Creating an App**
To create an app:
1.  Log in to DOTA Dashboard.
2.  Click the **Add new app** in the upper-right corner of the page (or press the `C` key).
3.  Populate the panel that appears with information about the new app.

**Note:**
If your app targets both iOS and Android, please create separate apps for each platform with DOTA (e.g., MyApp-iOS and MyApp-Android).

### Organization Management
The organization management section allows you to create and manage organizations. Organizations provide a way to group apps and collaborators for team-based workflows.
You can view all organizations associated with your account, manage organization settings, and control access to organization resources.

**Accessing Organizations**
All of your organizations are accessible in the left navigation panel of the DOTA Dashboard. Organizations are the owners of apps, so when you create an app in a different organization, that organization is automatically created if it doesn't already exist.

### Collaborator Management
DOTA allows you to add collaborators to your app, enabling other developers to deploy updates to your app's deployments. The collaborator management interface provides:
-   Adding new collaborators via email
-   Removing collaborators from your app
-   Viewing and managing all collaborators for your app

**Adding Users to an Organization**
You can add users to an organization indirectly through an app. Here's how:
1.  Select an app within an organization
2.  Click on "Go to app" and select "Collaborators" from the top toggle-tab options
3.  Select "Add collaborator"
4.  Type the user's email address to add the user

### Token Management
Tokens enable you to authenticate with the DOTA service without needing to use your Google credentials. The dashboard provides interfaces for:
-   Creating new tokens
-   Removing tokens that are no longer needed
-   Viewing all tokens associated with your account

### Deployment Management
From the DOTA perspective, an app is simply a named grouping for one or more "deployments." While the app represents a conceptual "namespace," its deployments represent the actual targets for releasing updates (for developers) and synchronizing updates (for end-users).

**Default Deployments**
Each app will have two deployments created by default: **Production** and **Staging**. These deployments are ready to use immediately after app creation.

**Deployment Actions**
The dashboard provides several ways to manage your deployments:
-   **Create** - Add new deployment environments beyond the default ones
-   **Search** - Find specific deployments from the dropdown menu
-   **Delete** - Remove deployments that are no longer needed
You can quickly access deployment actions by pressing `⌘`+`K` (Command+K) to open the command menu for creating and searching deployments.

**Copying Deployment Keys**
Deployment keys are required when configuring your mobile app to receive updates from DOTA. You can easily copy any deployment key directly from the dashboard using the "Copy Deployment Key" button.

**Deployment Management Table**
The deployments table shows key information about each deployment, including:
-   Label - The release identifier
-   Target Versions - The app versions this update applies to
-   Status - Current state of the deployment
-   Mandatory - Whether the update is required
-   Rollbacks - Number of automatic rollbacks
-   Active Devices - Number of devices using this version
-   Rollout - Percentage of users receiving this update
-   Released At - Timestamp of the release

**Note:**
Installation metrics are displayed in the deployment view, showing active users, total installations, pending updates, rollbacks, and more.

### Releasing and Managing Updates
The dashboard provides a user-friendly interface for managing updates to your apps, while the actual creation of releases is done through the CLI.

**Creating Releases**
Creating releases is performed exclusively through the DOTA CLI, not through the dashboard. For detailed instructions on how to create releases, please refer to the [CLI Usage Guide](https://dota.dreamsportslabs.com/documentation/cli/commands).
When creating a release using the CLI, you can specify:
-   Target deployment environment
-   Update packages to upload
-   Target binary versions
-   Update descriptions (changelog)
-   Mandatory update flags
-   Rollout percentages

**Note:**
While releases are created via CLI, you can view and manage them through the dashboard after they're created.

**Patching Update Metadata**
After releasing an update via CLI, you can modify one or more of the metadata attributes through the dashboard:
-   Mark an update as mandatory
-   Change the rollout percentage
-   Enable or disable specific releases
-   Update the release description

### Promoting Updates
Once you've tested an update in a specific deployment (e.g., Staging), you can promote it "downstream" (e.g., Production) using the dashboard. This creates a new release for the destination deployment with the same code and metadata from the source deployment's latest release.
When promoting an update, you can override certain properties like description, rollout percentage, and whether the update is mandatory.

### Rolling Back Updates
If you release an update that is broken or contains unintended features, you can easily roll it back using the dashboard. This will:
-   Disable the current release
-   Re-enable the previous working release
-   Use the CLI to roll back to a specific release

### Viewing Release History
The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of release history for each deployment, including:
-   Release labels and timestamps
-   Mandatory/disabled flags
-   Release descriptions
-   Author information
-   Installation metrics

### Analytics and Reporting
The dashboard provides analytics and reporting features to help you understand your app's update performance:
-   Installation success/failure rates
-   Active user counts
-   Device and OS distribution
-   Update adoption rates
-   Rollback occurrences
These analytics can help guide your deployment strategy and identify potential issues with specific updates or device types.
